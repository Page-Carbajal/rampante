# Implementation Plan: Simplify slash command by removing stack selection

**Branch**: `feature/002-feature-simplify-rampant` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: /Users/dubois/Source/repos/ai/rampante/specs/002-feature-simplify-rampant/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-feature-simplify-rampant/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Remove the stack-selection behavior from the Rampante slash command definition and generate a simplified command with fewer phases, while preserving the current command file as a Unix timestamped backup.

Technical approach (from research): Create a timestamped backup of `rampante/command/rampante.md`, then generate a new version that removes Phase 1 (Stack Selection and Validation) and Phase 2–3 (stack-dependent context loading and live documentation retrieval). Retain and adapt subsequent phases so the orchestrator focuses on spec generation, planning, task generation (delegated), and project overview. Ensure no references to `scripts/select-stack.sh` remain.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Deno 1.x)
**Primary Dependencies**: Deno standard library; repository scripts
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: deno test  
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux terminal environments
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Not performance-sensitive; aim for fast, deterministic command execution
**Constraints**: Maintain backward compatibility and determinism; avoid stack selection and external network requirements in the command
**Scale/Scope**: Small, self-contained change to command behavior and docs

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**:

- Projects: 1–2 (cli + tests), within limit
- Using framework directly: Yes (Deno CLI, repo scripts)
- Single data model: N/A (no data entities introduced)
- Avoiding patterns: Yes (no new abstractions introduced)

**Architecture**:

- No new libraries added; modify existing command definition
- CLI remains the primary interface; no wrappers introduced
- Documentation adjustments captured in quickstart.md

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- Plan failing contract/integration tests for command behavior before changes (simulate invoking orchestrator without stack selection)
- Order: Contract → Integration → Unit (if any)
- Real dependencies only (repo scripts); no mocks
- No implementation before tests (enforced during execution)

**Observability**:

- Console output remains structured and explicit; errors include actionable context

**Versioning**:

- Treat as non-breaking change to command behavior; bump patch/build version per existing release process

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) – no frontend/backend split required

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests (described), quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
