# Research: Rampante Complete Spec Kit Automation System

## Decisions

### CLI-Specific Template Architecture

**Decision**: Multi-format template system with native CLI integration

- **Gemini CLI**: TOML format in `.gemini/commands/rampante.toml`
- **Codex**: Markdown format in `~/.codex/prompts/rampante.md`
- **Cursor**: YAML format in `.cursor/commands/rampante.mdc`
- **Claude Code**: JSON format in `.claude/commands/rampante.md`

**Rationale**: Each AI CLI has established conventions for slash command registration. Native formats ensure seamless integration, reduce complexity, and leverage existing CLI capabilities.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Universal config format: Rejected - would require CLI modifications
- JavaScript-based templates: Rejected - security concerns, execution complexity
- External service integration: Rejected - introduces network dependencies

### Release Workflow Architecture

**Decision**: GitHub Actions-based automated release pipeline

- Triggered by merge to main
- Generates CLI-specific packages in parallel
- Uploads to GitHub Releases with checksums
- Creates manifest file with package metadata

**Rationale**: Leverages existing GitHub infrastructure, provides reliable hosting, supports parallel builds, integrates with existing development workflow.

**Alternatives considered**:

- External CI/CD platform: Rejected - additional complexity, cost
- Manual release process: Rejected - error-prone, doesn't scale
- NPM/JSR-based distribution: Rejected - doesn't support CLI-specific packages

### Preview Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Template-based simulation without execution

- Parse user prompt and generate expected command inputs
- Use static templates to show what each Spec Kit command would produce
- Format output as structured markdown matching actual command output
- No file system modifications during preview

**Rationale**: Provides accurate previews without side effects, fast execution, predictable output format.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Actual command execution with rollback: Rejected - complex, risk of side effects
- AI-based content generation: Rejected - unpredictable, requires external dependencies
- Mock command execution: Rejected - complex setup, maintenance burden

### Installation Distribution Strategy

**Decision**: Direct download from GitHub Releases with integrity verification

- Installer detects user's CLI environment
- Downloads appropriate package for detected CLI
- Verifies package integrity using checksums
- Extracts and installs templates to correct locations

**Rationale**: Simple, reliable, leverages GitHub's CDN, supports offline operation after download.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Package manager distribution: Rejected - different package managers per CLI
- Self-hosted distribution: Rejected - infrastructure costs, maintenance overhead
- Peer-to-peer distribution: Rejected - complexity, reliability concerns

### Workflow Orchestration Design

**Decision**: Sequential execution with state tracking

- Execute /specify → capture output and file paths
- Execute /plan with spec file path → capture plan output
- Execute /tasks with plan file path → capture tasks output
- Provide progress feedback and error recovery

**Rationale**: Mirrors manual workflow, preserves command dependencies, enables recovery from partial failures.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Parallel execution: Rejected - commands have dependencies
- Single mega-command: Rejected - loses granularity, harder to debug
- Event-driven orchestration: Rejected - unnecessary complexity for linear workflow

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting

- Validate prerequisites before execution (Spec Kit presence, CLI compatibility)
- Provide specific error messages with recovery guidance
- Support partial workflow completion with resume capability
- Log detailed context for debugging

**Rationale**: CLI tools need robust error handling for good user experience, enables self-service problem resolution.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Fail-fast approach: Rejected - poor user experience
- Silent error handling: Rejected - makes debugging impossible
- Automatic retry logic: Rejected - could cause infinite loops, user confusion

## Implementation Notes

- Templates will be developed iteratively, starting with Gemini and Codex (known formats)
- Release workflow will include comprehensive testing of generated packages
- Installation process will include dry-run mode for preview before actual installation
- Documentation will include troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Open Questions (resolved)

All technical unknowns have been resolved through the above decisions.
