# Feature Specification: Rampante - Complete Spec Kit Automation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-rampante-slash`
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "FEATURE: \"Rampante\" Slash Command. This tool lets users preview what Spec Kit automation will do before running it. Users want to see what files and content will be generated by /specify, /plan, and /tasks commands before actually executing them. They also want a single command that can run the entire Spec Kit workflow automatically. The tool should: 1. Generate an MD file used to execute the Spec Kit commands supporting Drymode - Support --dry-run flag to show previews without execution 2. Generate a Github Workflow for releases to generate 1 zip file per CLI based on the templates 3. Install a /rampante slash command in AI CLIs (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code) by downloading the zip files from step 2 4. Work in any directory that already has Spec Kit installed 5. Show exactly what each Spec Kit command would generate 6. Allow users to run the full Spec Kit workflow with a single command The problem this solves: - Users can't preview Spec Kit operations before committing to them - Users have to manually run /specify, then /plan, then /tasks in sequence - No way to see the complete workflow output ahead of time - Different AI CLIs need different installation methods This tool bridges the gap between manual Spec Kit usage and automated workflow execution while giving users confidence through preview functionality."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: preview functionality, workflow automation, multi-CLI distribution
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: dry-run mode, template generation, release workflow, CLI installation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Preview mode, automation workflow, installation, and release scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (templates, packages, installations, workflows)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers should remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

AI CLI users working with Spec Kit need a comprehensive automation system that provides preview capabilities and streamlined workflow execution. They want to see exactly what files and content will be generated before committing to the full Spec Kit process, and they need a single command that can execute the complete /specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks workflow automatically. The system must work across different AI CLIs with appropriate installation mechanisms.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user has Spec Kit installed, **When** they run `/rampante --dry-run "Build user authentication"`, **Then** they see a detailed preview of what /specify, /plan, and /tasks would generate without any files being created
2. **Given** user wants full automation, **When** they run `/rampante "Build user authentication"`, **Then** system executes the complete Spec Kit workflow and generates all specification files
3. **Given** maintainer creates new release, **When** release workflow triggers, **Then** system generates CLI-specific distribution packages for Gemini, Codex, Cursor, and Claude Code
4. **Given** user wants to install Rampante, **When** they run installation command for their AI CLI, **Then** system downloads appropriate package and installs /rampante slash command
5. **Given** user runs Rampante in non-Spec Kit directory, **When** command executes, **Then** they receive clear error about missing Spec Kit installation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Spec Kit commands fail during automated workflow execution?
- How does system handle network failures during package downloads?
- What occurs when CLI-specific templates become outdated?
- How does preview mode handle commands that would generate extremely large outputs?
- What happens when release workflow fails for some CLIs but succeeds for others?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Functionality

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide dry-run preview mode that shows what /specify, /plan, and /tasks would generate without executing them
- **FR-002**: System MUST support automated execution of the complete Spec Kit workflow (/specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks) with a single command
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate Spec Kit installation before operating in any directory
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve exact functionality and output format of individual Spec Kit commands
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide structured markdown output for preview mode that clearly shows each command's expected results

#### Multi-CLI Distribution

- **FR-006**: System MUST support installation across multiple AI CLI environments (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code)
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate CLI-specific templates and configuration files for each supported AI CLI
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide automated installation mechanism that downloads appropriate packages for target CLI
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure installed slash commands work within each CLI's native LLM context with access to other commands

#### Release and Distribution

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide automated release workflow that generates separate distribution packages for each AI CLI
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate template integrity and compatibility before packaging
- **FR-012**: System MUST version distribution packages and provide compatibility checking
- **FR-013**: System MUST make packages available via stable download URLs with integrity verification
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle release workflow failures gracefully without corrupting existing packages

#### Error Handling and Reliability

- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear error messages when prerequisites are missing or operations fail
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle partial workflow failures and provide meaningful recovery guidance
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate flag positioning and provide helpful correction messages for invalid usage
- **FR-018**: System MUST work offline after initial installation and package downloads

#### Integration and Compatibility

- **FR-019**: System MUST work with existing Spec Kit installations without requiring modifications to Spec Kit

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Slash Command Template**: CLI-specific configuration files that define /rampante behavior within each AI CLI environment
- **Distribution Package**: Versioned zip files containing CLI-specific templates, configurations, and installation instructions
- **Release Manifest**: Index of available packages, versions, and download URLs for installation discovery
- **Workflow Execution Context**: Runtime information tracking the state of automated Spec Kit command execution
- **Preview Generator**: Logic that simulates Spec Kit command execution to show expected outputs without side effects
- **Installation Validator**: Component that verifies Spec Kit presence and CLI compatibility before operation
