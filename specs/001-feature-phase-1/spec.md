# Feature Specification: Phase 1 ‚Äì Multi-CLI Rampant Slash Command (Codex first)

- **Feature Branch**: `001-feature-phase-1`
- **Created**: 2025-09-07
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Updated definition: "Provide a Deno-invoked entry command `deno run npm:run-rampant install <cli>` (Deno v2.4+) that configures context7, installs `/recommended-stacks` and all stack files in the current directory, and installs a unified slash/command named `/rampant` for the target CLI. Phase 1 implements `<cli>=codex` (copy `/rampant-command/rampant.md` to `~/.codex/prompts`). Future phases add: gemini, claude-code, cursor, etc. The `/rampant` command triggers the entire Spec Kit flow from a single prompt."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I can install and configure the `/rampant` command for my CLI using `deno run npm:run-rampant install <cli>` (Phase 1: `<cli>=codex`). This sets up context7, installs `/recommended-stacks` and `/rampant-command/rampant.md` in the current directory, and registers the `/rampant` command for the target CLI (for Codex: copy to `~/.codex/prompts`).

Then I can run `/rampant <main prompt>` to execute the end-to-end Spec Kit workflow: determine project type, select a recommended stack, fetch latest docs via context7, run `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks`, and produce `specs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` for stakeholders.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have not installed the toolchain, **When** I run `deno run npm:run-rampant install <CLI>` on Deno v2.4+, **Then** context7 is configured for the given CLI. E.g. `~/.codex/config.toml` for Open AI's Codex CLI, `/recommended-stacks` (including `DEFINITIONS.md` and stack files) and `/rampant-command/rampant.md` are installed in the current directory, and the `/rampant` CLI slash command is registered to the appropriate location. E.g. (by copying `/rampant-command/rampant.md` to `~/.codex/prompts`) for Open AI's Codex CLI.
2. **Given** installation is complete, **When** I invoke `/rampant <main prompt>`, **Then** the system identifies the project type from the prompt using `/recommended-stacks/DEFINITIONS.md` and selects the correct stack.
3. **Given** a selected stack name (SELECTED-STACK), **When** `/rampant` executes, **Then** the system loads `/recommended-stacks/SELECTED-STACK.md` and uses context7 to fetch the latest documentation for that stack.
4. **Given** the main prompt, selected stack, and latest docs, **When** `/rampant` runs, **Then** it executes `/specify` with the main prompt, `/plan` with the selected stack plus updated docs, and `/tasks` with the prompt "Generate the MVP for this project".
5. **Given** those results, **When** processing completes, **Then** the system generates `specs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` summarizing the plan, tasks, and stack specs.

### Edge Cases

**Cross-CLI (Phase 1: Codex; Phase 2: Claude Code, Gemini)**

- Missing or unreadable `~/.codex/config.toml` (Codex): create or update context7 entries; if permission denied, report clear guidance. For other CLIs, use their equivalent config path in later phases.
- `/recommended-stacks/DEFINITIONS.md` absent or malformed: create a starter template and warn.
- Ambiguous project type (multiple matching stacks): YOLO selection with deterministic tie-break (no prompting).
- SELECTED-STACK file missing (e.g., `/recommended-stacks/<NAME>.md` not found): fail gracefully with instructions to add or regenerate the file.
- Context7 MCP unavailable or network failure: fail hard with a clear error message; do not continue.
- Existing `specs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`: always overwrite.
- Re-running installation command is idempotent (add missing only); support `--force` to drop and recreate folders/files.
- `deno` unavailable: require Deno v2.4+ and provide installation guidance.
- Installing for unsupported CLIs in Phase 1 (e.g., `gemini`, `claude-code`, `cursor`): return a clear "target not yet supported" error while preserving installed assets.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Deno-invoked entry command `deno run npm:run-rampant install <cli>` (requires Deno v2.4+) that performs initial setup for the specified CLI; Phase 1 supports `<cli>=codex`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure context7 is configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`; if missing, create the file and add the following:
  - `[mcp_servers.context7]` with `command = "npx"` and `args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]`.
- **FR-003**: System MUST install or ensure presence of `/recommended-stacks` folder with a `DEFINITIONS.md` that lists available stacks and ship with a minimal initial set of stack definition files.
- **FR-004**: System MUST install or ensure presence of `/rampant-command/` folder with a `rampant.md` file which is then used to register the slash/command for the given CLI.
- **FR-005**: For Codex, System MUST expose a slash command named `/rampant` by copying `/rampant-command/rampant.md` to `~/.codex/prompts`.
- **FR-006**: System MUST analyze the main prompt and determine the most appropriate project type/stack using `/recommended-stacks/DEFINITIONS.md` with a YOLO strategy (no user prompting).
- **FR-007**: When multiple stacks match, System MUST auto-pick the top match deterministically (e.g., highest score; ties broken by order in `DEFINITIONS.md`).
- **FR-008**: System MUST load `/recommended-stacks/SELECTED-STACK.md` where `SELECTED-STACK` matches the chosen stack name from definitions.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use context7 MCP to retrieve the latest documentation relevant to the SELECTED-STACK before planning; if context7/network is unavailable, fail with a clear error message.
- **FR-010**: System MUST run `/specify` with the main prompt and capture outputs for later summarization.
- **FR-011**: System MUST run `/plan` using the SELECTED-STACK plus its updated documentation and capture outputs.
- **FR-012**: System MUST run `/tasks` with the prompt "Generate the MVP for this project" and capture outputs.
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate `specs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` that summarizes `/plan` results, `/tasks` output, and the stack specifications used; when this file exists, always overwrite.
- **FR-014**: Setup operations MUST be idempotent; on re-run add only missing files/folders; a `--force` flag MUST drop and recreate installed folders/files.
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear user feedback and warnings when stack selection is ambiguous or when documentation refresh fails.
 
Phase 2 priorities (planning):
- **FR-018**: Add support for `<cli>=claude-code` with equivalent installation, context7 configuration, and `/rampant` registration semantics (exact registration path and conventions to be defined during Phase 2).
- **FR-019**: Add support for `<cli>=gemini` with equivalent installation, context7 configuration, and `/rampant` registration semantics (exact registration path and conventions to be defined during Phase 2).
- **FR-016**: The architecture MUST support additional CLI targets (Gemini, Claude Code, Cursor) in later phases without changing the core Spec Kit workflow; keep `/rampant` as the cross-CLI command name.
- **FR-017**: If a non-implemented CLI target is specified in Phase 1, the system MUST return a clear "target not yet supported" message and exit without side effects.

_Clarifications resolved:_

- Deno version: v2.4+ required.
- Entry command: `deno run npm:run-rampant install <cli>` (Phase 1: `<cli>=codex`).
- Slash command registration: copy to the appropriate CLI placement. E.g. `/rampant-command/rampant.md` to `~/.codex/prompts` for Open AI's Codex CLI.
- Overwrite policy: always overwrite `specs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`; for installed assets, add missing on re-runs; `--force` to drop/recreate.
- Stack selection: YOLO (no prompts); deterministic auto-pick when ties.
- Installation path: install `/recommended-stacks` in the current directory; create `~/.codex/config.toml` if missing.
- Context7 behavior: configure as specified; fail hard if unavailable.
- Multi-CLI scope: design supports future targets (Gemini, Claude Code, Cursor) with the same `/rampant` command name across CLIs.
