# GITHUB-WORKFLOWS Stack

## Overview and Philosophy

This stack is designed for creating robust and efficient CI/CD pipelines and automation using GitHub Actions. The philosophy is to provide a collection of common, reusable workflow patterns that can be adapted for various projects. The focus is on maintainability, security, and speed.

## Core Technologies

- **GitHub Actions**: The core of the automation.
- **YAML**: The language used to define workflows.
- **Shell Scripting**: For custom logic within workflow steps.
- **Docker**: For creating containerized build and test environments.

## Project Structure

A typical project using this stack will have a `.github/workflows` directory in the root of the repository. Each YAML file in this directory represents a separate workflow.

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml
    ├── cd.yml
    └── release.yml
```

## Development Workflow

1.  **Create a new workflow file**: Add a new YAML file to the `.github/workflows` directory.
2.  **Define triggers**: Specify when the workflow should run (e.g., on push, on pull request, on a schedule).
3.  **Set up jobs**: Define one or more jobs that will run in parallel or sequentially.
4.  **Add steps**: Each job consists of a series of steps that execute commands or actions.
5.  **Use actions**: Leverage pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace to simplify common tasks.
6.  **Test the workflow**: Push the new workflow to a feature branch to test it before merging to main.

## Testing Approach

- **Linting**: Use a YAML linter to check for syntax errors in the workflow files.
- **Local Testing**: Use a tool like `act` to run the workflows locally.
- **Branch Testing**: Always test new or modified workflows on a feature branch before merging to the main branch.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Environments**: Use GitHub Actions environments to manage deployments to different stages (e.g., staging, production).
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information like API keys and passwords in GitHub Actions secrets.
- **Manual Approvals**: For production deployments, consider adding a manual approval step to the workflow.

- **GitHub Actions**: `/github/docs/actions`
- **YAML**: `/yaml/docs`
- **Docker**: `/docker/docs`
