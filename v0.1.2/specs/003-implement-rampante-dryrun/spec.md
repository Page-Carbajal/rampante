# Feature Specification: Implement /rampante Dryrun support

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-rampante-dryrun`
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement `/rampante` Dryrun support when the prompt starts with --dry-run. Execute returns the prompts which will be passed to every command like `/specify` `/plan` and `/tasks` and the sub commands without ever actually calling them."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a CLI user running the `/rampante` command, when I prefix my prompt with `--dry-run`, I see the exact prompts that would be sent to each relevant subcommand (e.g., `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, and any involved sub-commands) without those commands actually executing.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid `/rampante` prompt that begins with `--dry-run`, **When** the command is executed, **Then** the system returns a structured list of generated prompts for each relevant command in the flow and does not execute any commands.
2. **Given** a `/rampante` prompt without `--dry-run`, **When** the command is executed, **Then** the system proceeds with normal execution and does not return the generated prompts list.
3. **Given** a `--dry-run` prompt with additional arguments or content after the flag, **When** executed, **Then** the system uses the remaining prompt content to generate the same prompts it would normally produce, and returns them without executing.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the prompt includes `--dry-run` not at the start? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How should the system behave if no subcommands would be invoked (empty prompt or unsupported flow)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How are extremely long prompts summarized or paginated to remain readable? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Should `--dry-run` support synonyms (e.g., `--dryrun`, `-n`) or only the exact flag? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How should errors that would occur during generation (e.g., invalid prompt) be represented in dry run output? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Does dry run apply exclusively to `/rampante` or to other top-level commands as well? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST detect when the user prompt for `/rampante` starts with `--dry-run` and enable dry-run behavior for that invocation.
- **FR-002**: In dry-run mode, the system MUST generate the same set of prompts that would be sent to each relevant command (e.g., `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, and sub-commands) for the given input.
- **FR-003**: In dry-run mode, the system MUST NOT execute any commands; it MUST only return/show the generated prompts.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST present the generated prompts in a clear, structured format that identifies the intended target command for each prompt.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST ensure normal execution occurs when the prompt does not start with `--dry-run`.
- **FR-006**: The system SHOULD make it clear in the output that dry-run mode is active to avoid confusion with real execution.
- **FR-007**: The system SHOULD handle additional user-provided prompt content following `--dry-run` and use it as the basis for prompt generation.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD provide a concise summary of which commands would be invoked and in which order, alongside their associated prompts.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST avoid any side effects or persistent changes during a dry run.
- **FR-010**: The system SHOULD surface any validation issues with the input prompt in a non-blocking way (e.g., mark them in the output) without executing commands.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST make clear how dry-run mode interacts with other flags or options when present. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Dry-Run Request**: A user invocation of `/rampante` prefixed with `--dry-run`; includes the raw prompt content used for generation.
- **Generated Prompt**: A textual prompt associated with a specific target command (e.g., `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`); includes the target command name and the full prompt text.
