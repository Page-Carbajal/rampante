# Feature Specification: Simplify slash command by removing stack selection

**Feature Branch**: `002-feature-simplify-rampant`
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "FEATURE: Simplify Rampant. Remove execution of the file script/select-stack.sh"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user invoking the Rampante slash command, I get a streamlined experience because the command definition no longer triggers stack selection and its phases are simplified; before the new definition is generated, the current file is preserved with a Unix timestamped copy.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the current slash command definition exists at `rampante/command/rampante.md`, When the feature is applied, Then a backup of the existing file is created with a Unix timestamp in its name and a new, simplified definition is generated as the active command file.
2. Given a user invokes the `/rampante.md` slash command after the change, When the command runs, Then no stack-selection step occurs and only the simplified phases are presented to the user.
3. Given multiple updates occur close in time, When backups are created, Then each backup filename remains unique and the latest simplified definition is active. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: uniqueness strategy when updates happen within the same second]

### Edge Cases

- What happens if `rampante/command/rampante.md` is missing or already archived? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: create fresh definition vs. fail]
- What exact format and placement should the Unix timestamped backup use (e.g., `rampante/command/rampante.<epoch>.md` vs. an archive subfolder)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How should rollbacks work if users want to restore a previous command definition? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How should automated/CI flows behave if they previously depended on stack-selection behavior? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The slash command definition MUST no longer call or reference stack selection (remove dependence on stack selection behavior).
- **FR-002**: A new version of the slash command definition MUST be generated with simplified phases. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which phases remain and what ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù means]
- **FR-003**: Before replacement, the current command definition MUST be preserved as a backup with a Unix timestamped filename.
- **FR-004**: The newly generated simplified definition MUST be the active definition used when users invoke the slash command.
- **FR-005**: Existing users MUST experience no interruptions; invoking the command MUST not prompt for stack selection.
- **FR-006**: The process MUST provide a clear note or documentation of the change and how to locate backups.
- **FR-007**: A retention policy for timestamped backups MUST be defined. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many backups to keep and for how long]
- **FR-008**: Success MUST be measurable via reduced steps in the command flow and decreased time to complete it. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target metrics]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- No new data entities are introduced by this feature.
