# Feature Specification: Rampante - Spec Kit Preview and Automation Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-tool`
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a tool called \"Rampante\" that lets users preview what Spec Kit automation will do before running it. Users want to see what files and content will be generated by /specify, /plan, and /tasks commands before actually executing them. They also want a single command that can run the entire Spec Kit workflow automatically. The tool should: - Install a /rampante slash command in AI CLIs (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code) - Support --dry-run flag to show previews without execution - Work in any directory that already has Spec Kit installed - Show exactly what each Spec Kit command would generate - Allow users to run the full workflow with a single command The problem this solves: - Users can't preview Spec Kit operations before committing to them - Users have to manually run /specify, then /plan, then /tasks in sequence - No way to see the complete workflow output ahead of time - Different AI CLIs need different installation methods This tool bridges the gap between manual Spec Kit usage and automated workflow execution while giving users confidence through preview functionality."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: preview functionality, workflow automation, multi-CLI support
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: AI CLI users, Spec Kit workflows, preview/dry-run capability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Preview scenarios and automation workflows clearly defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (installer, commands, templates)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers should remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

AI CLI users working with Spec Kit want to understand what files and content will be generated before committing to creating them. They also want to automate the multi-step Spec Kit workflow (/specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks) with a single command while maintaining the ability to preview outcomes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has Spec Kit installed in their project, **When** they run `/rampante --dry-run "Add user authentication"`, **Then** they see a preview of what /specify, /plan, and /tasks would generate without any files being created
2. **Given** a user wants to run the full workflow, **When** they run `/rampante "Add user authentication"`, **Then** the system automatically executes /specify, /plan, and /tasks in sequence
3. **Given** a user wants to install Rampante for their AI CLI, **When** they run the installation command, **Then** the /rampante slash command becomes available in their CLI environment
4. **Given** a user runs `/rampante` in a directory without Spec Kit, **When** the command executes, **Then** they receive a clear error message explaining Spec Kit is required

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Spec Kit commands fail during automated workflow execution?
- How does the system handle partial failures in multi-step automation?
- What occurs when CLI-specific installation conflicts with existing configurations?
- How does the preview handle commands that would generate very large outputs?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide installation capability for multiple AI CLI environments (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code)
- **FR-002**: System MUST install a `/rampante` slash command that works within each CLI's native environment
- **FR-003**: System MUST support a `--dry-run` flag that shows previews without executing any file operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect when Spec Kit is installed in the current directory before operating
- **FR-005**: System MUST automate the sequential execution of /specify, /plan, and /tasks commands when run without --dry-run
- **FR-006**: System MUST show exactly what content each Spec Kit command would generate during preview mode
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve the original functionality and output format of individual Spec Kit commands
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages when prerequisites are missing or operations fail
- **FR-009**: System MUST work with existing Spec Kit installations without requiring modifications to Spec Kit itself
- **FR-010**: System MUST support different AI CLI command formats [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific format requirements for each CLI not detailed]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Installation Command**: Represents the tool that distributes CLI-specific configurations to appropriate locations
- **Slash Command Definition**: The `/rampante` command configuration that gets installed in each AI CLI
- **Preview Generator**: Logic that simulates Spec Kit command execution and shows expected outputs
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Manages the sequential execution of /specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks commands
- **CLI Template**: Format-specific command definitions for different AI CLI environments
