# Feature Specification: Rampante Release Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-noted-requirements`
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I noted requirements started with System MUST provide installation capability for multiple AI CLI environments (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code)

However there is no information about a Release Workflow which generates 1 zip per CLI, these files will be downloaded and installed for the /rampante command installations."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: missing release workflow for CLI-specific distributions
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: release process, CLI-specific packages, distribution mechanism
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Release workflow scenarios and distribution validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (release artifacts, CLI packages)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers should remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Rampante maintainers need an automated release workflow that packages CLI-specific templates and configurations into downloadable zip files. Each AI CLI (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code) gets its own distribution package that the Rampante installer can download and deploy to the appropriate CLI configuration directories.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** new Rampante version is ready for release, **When** maintainer triggers release workflow, **Then** system generates 4 CLI-specific zip files and makes them available for download
2. **Given** release workflow completes, **When** user runs Rampante installer, **Then** installer downloads the correct zip file for their target CLI and extracts templates to proper locations
3. **Given** release includes template updates, **When** zip files are generated, **Then** each zip contains only the templates and configs relevant to its target CLI
4. **Given** release workflow fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** maintainers receive clear error messages and can identify which CLI packages failed to build

### Edge Cases

- What happens when template generation fails for one CLI but succeeds for others?
- How does system handle version mismatches between templates and installer?
- What occurs when download servers are unavailable during installation?
- How does workflow manage backwards compatibility with older Rampante versions?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate separate distribution packages for each supported AI CLI (Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code)
- **FR-002**: System MUST include only CLI-specific templates and configurations in each package
- **FR-003**: System MUST version each release package to enable compatibility checking
- **FR-004**: System MUST make packages available for download via stable URLs
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate template integrity before packaging
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate checksums for each package to verify download integrity
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a manifest file listing available packages and their versions
- **FR-008**: System MUST support automated triggering of release workflow [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: trigger mechanism - git tags, manual, CI/CD?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle partial release failures gracefully without corrupting existing packages
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many previous versions should be supported?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Release Package**: Represents a CLI-specific zip file containing templates, configurations, and metadata for one AI CLI
- **Release Manifest**: Central index of all available packages, versions, and download URLs
- **Template Bundle**: Collection of CLI-specific templates and configuration files ready for packaging
- **Version Metadata**: Information about package version, compatibility, and release notes
